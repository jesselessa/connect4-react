## Demo

You can play the game [here](https://jesselessa.github.io/connect4-react).

## Stack

This project has been created with React using Create React App. It uses Class components (before React 16.8, it was the only way to track state and lifecycle on a React component).

## Game Rules

- First, decide which player goes first (player 1 has the red tokens, player 2, the yellow ones).Players must alternate turns.
- On your turn, drop one of your colored tokens from the top into any of the seven slots.
- The game ends when there is a 4-in-a-row or a stalemate.
- Click on the 'Reset' button to start a new game.
- The starter of the previous game goes second on the next game.

## Run the project locally

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the location where you want the local repository to be copied.
2. Clone the repository : `git clone https://github.com/jesselessa/connect4-react.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory : `cd connect4-react`
4. Install dependencies required in the project : `npm install`
5. Run the application in development mode : `npm start`
6. Open http://localhost:3000 in your preferred browser to view the development server.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
